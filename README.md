# basic-CS50-Scratch-project
Oh hey guys, I hope you check out this short just-for-fun Scratch project. I worked on it as a part of CS50's Introduction to CS course recommended by a friend. And this is my first ever attempt at Scratch. As the title suggests, this is a witch's love story. I will try to give a brief idea about it: Among the woods, there once lived a witch who loved to prey on wild bats during the darkness of night. On one such hunt, as she used her powers to throw her magic energy ball at them, one of the bats revealed himself to be a handsome vampire.

Important controls: SPACE-BAR, a key, b key.

Do not press any key unless the cat (also a storyteller) gives the hint[To press the SPACE BAR].
Once the cat has disappeared, you will see the witch flying mischievously while the bats break into chaos. Now you may go ahead and press the 'b' key to position the witch to the bottom left to enable her to fire her magic balls.
Then you can again press the 'a' key so that the conjured magic energy ball by the witch is controlled by the mouse pointer. Your mission is to try and touch the magic ball to the largest bat you can find(which is, unknown to the witch, a vampire). 

This will cause the great revelation and the lives and fates of the bats and the witch will forever be changed. Enjoy the story. Hope you like the cat humor. I hope I will try to improve it in the future. Only one howling sound is used in this project. Please like and share. :)

Oh and I got some of the pictures for sprites and backdrops from Google and the rest are provided by Scratch itself.
